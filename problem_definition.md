# Problem Definition

## Problem Statement
Illegal deforestation in non-tropical regions (temperate and boreal forests) is difficult to detect using traditional ground-based surveys due to large spatial extents, seasonal snow cover, and high monitoring costs. Most existing deforestation monitoring systems are optimized for tropical regions, creating a gap in effective monitoring solutions for non-tropical forests.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objective
To design and implement a low-cost remote sensing–based system for detecting and tracking illegal deforestation in non-tropical regions using freely available satellite data.

### Secondary Objectives
- To analyze multi-temporal satellite imagery for forest change detection
- To account for seasonal effects such as snow cover and phenological variation
- To validate detected forest loss using globally recognized datasets
- To visualize deforestation patterns for decision support

## Scope

### In Scope
- Non-tropical forest regions (temperate and boreal)
- Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data
- Google Earth Engine for large-scale processing
- Global Forest Watch for validation
- Academic and non-commercial use

### Out of Scope
- Tropical rainforest monitoring
- Commercial enforcement systems
- High-resolution paid satellite imagery
- Legal or policy enforcement mechanisms

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Cloud cover and snow affect optical imagery
- Medium spatial resolution of public satellite data
- Dependence on open-access datasets

### Assumptions
- Forest loss events are detectable at Sentinel spatial resolution
- Temporal satellite coverage is sufficient for monitoring
- The system is intended for monitoring, not legal enforcement
